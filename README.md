# 1. Introduction

# 2. Problem

Neurowallet combines DeFi (Decentralized Finance) technologies, Artificial Intelligence, and WhatsApp integration to solve critical problems faced by Individual Microentrepreneurs (MEIs) and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).

### The Fiscal and Bureaucratic Problem for SMEs

#### Brazilian Scenario

In Brazil, the fiscal situation for small businesses is particularly challenging. Sage research reveals an alarming reality: microenterprises with up to five employees pay approximately 65% of their revenue in taxes, while small businesses (5-19 employees) pay 42%, and medium-sized businesses (20-199 employees) pay 30%. This disproportionate distribution shows how smaller businesses are more severely impacted by the tax system.

Bureaucratic complexity further aggravates this scenario. Brazilian microenterprises spend an average of 14.5 days per year exclusively on tax accounting, equivalent to 2.6% of annual work dedicated solely to complying with tax obligations.

However, formalization brings substantial benefits. Studies by Sebrae in partnership with FGV demonstrate that the economic effect of formalizing MEIs moves between R$19.81 billion and R$69.56 billion annually in Brazil. Entrepreneurs experience a 7% to 25% increase in their income after formalization, with data showing that formalized entrepreneurs can earn up to three times more, with an average additional R$2,300 monthly.

#### Portuguese Scenario

In Portugal, SMEs also face considerable challenges, although with some important distinctions compared to Brazil. The country has one of the highest tax burdens in the European Union, with a total tax and contribution rate for companies estimated at approximately 39.8% of commercial profits, according to World Bank data.

Portuguese SMEs constitute the backbone of the national economy, representing 99.9% of the country's business fabric, accounting for 78.4% of employment and generating 63.5% of total added value. Despite this fundamental importance, these companies face administrative complexity that limits their growth potential.

Data from PwC and the World Bank indicate that Portuguese companies spend an average of 243 hours per year to comply with their tax obligations, significantly above the European average of 163 hours. For micro and small businesses with limited resources, this time represents a substantial indirect operational cost that directly affects their competitiveness.

The Portuguese tax system establishes for SMEs a Corporate Income Tax (IRC) with a standard rate of 21%, with reductions to 17% on the first €25,000 for small companies. Additionally, there is the municipal surcharge (up to 1.5%) and the state tax for higher profits, creating several layers of fiscal complexity.

### The Informal Economy and Its Costs

The informal economy represents a significant challenge in both Portugal and Brazil. In Portugal, it is estimated that the undeclared economy corresponds to approximately 17.5% of GDP, according to studies by the National Statistics Institute (INE). This percentage represents about €37.7 billion operating outside the formal system.

This informality has negative consequences for both the entrepreneurs themselves and the economy as a whole. Informal entrepreneurs face severe limitations, including:

1. Restricted access to credit and financial services
2. Inability to issue official invoices
3. Difficulties in establishing formal business partnerships
4. Exclusion from government business support programs
5. Limitations for export and internationalization

Studies by COTEC Portugal indicate that formalized companies have access to a potential market up to 3.6 times larger than informal companies, with an average revenue increase of 22% after formalization. Additionally, formalized entrepreneurs are 46% more likely to obtain bank credit and 58% more likely to establish partnerships with larger companies.

***"A significant problem, but we have many like this in the world, how can we solve it?"***

# 3. Solution

Neurowallet presents an innovative approach to the challenges faced by SMEs and MEIs, integrating three fundamental technological elements:

1. **Blockchain and DeFi Technology:** The use of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts allows for transactions with reduced costs, greater transparency, and security guaranteed by the distributed nature of the blockchain. This infrastructure eliminates traditional intermediaries, significantly reducing operational costs.

2. **Advanced Artificial Intelligence:** AI systems capable of processing texts and images to facilitate transactions, automate bureaucratic processes, and provide personalized financial insights. The AI analyzes tax documents, identifies legitimate tax optimization opportunities, and simplifies regulatory compliance.

3. **WhatsApp Interface:** Accessibility through an already widely used messaging platform eliminates the need for adaptation to new applications. This approach drastically reduces the learning curve, making advanced financial technologies accessible to entrepreneurs with different levels of technological familiarity.

***Why Whatsapp?***

Integrating Neurowallet with WhatsApp is a strategic decision that capitalizes on the app's widespread adoption in Brazil, Portugal and other coutries. In Brazil, WhatsApp more than 90% of cellphone owners use it everyday, while in Portugal, it's used by 93%. This extensive user base provides Neurowallet with an instant, familiar platform for its DeFi and AI-powered financial services.

By leveraging WhatsApp's popularity, Neurowallet overcomes significant barriers to entry, especially for small entrepreneurs and MEIs who may be hesitant to adopt new financial technologies. The familiarity of WhatsApp's interface reduces the learning curve, making advanced financial tools accessible to a broader audience. This approach is particularly beneficial in promoting financial inclusion and encouraging formalization of informal businesses.

### Specific Benefits for Entrepreneurs

For entrepreneurs in Portugal and Brazil, Neurowallet offers tangible benefits that directly address the identified problems:

1. **Reduction of Tax Costs:** The use of cryptocurrencies for commercial transactions allows for legitimate tax optimization, reducing operational costs compared to traditional banking systems. This economy can be particularly significant for international transactions, which currently can cost up to 7.5% of the transacted value through traditional banks.

2. **Bureaucratic Simplification:** The automation of administrative and fiscal processes through AI significantly reduces the hours dedicated to these tasks. Considering that Portuguese companies spend 243 hours annually on tax obligations, a reduction of just 30% in this time would represent a gain of more than 70 productive hours per year.

3. **Incentive for Formalization:** Operational ease and cost reduction make formalization more attractive and accessible. For informal entrepreneurs in Portugal, formalization facilitated by Neurowallet could represent an average increase of 22% in their revenue, following patterns observed in studies on business formalization.

4. **Facilitated International Transactions:** The possibility of operating globally with reduced costs is especially relevant for trade between Portugal and Brazil, which annually moves more than €2.3 billion and involves thousands of small companies in both countries.

5. **Digital Financial Inclusion:** Access to advanced financial services through a familiar interface eliminates technological barriers. This feature is particularly relevant in Portugal, where ANACOM data indicates that 93.7% of Portuguese smartphone owners regularly use WhatsApp.

***"Okay, but who is actually affected by this?"***

## 3.1 Personas

Personas are fictional representations of target users that encapsulate typical characteristics, interests, goals, and challenges of a specific audience. They help product teams better understand customer needs and create solutions that meet their expectations.

Personas are essential in the design thinking process and product development, facilitating the creation of more relevant and effective products or services.
